            This file provides board-specific configuration data for the Morse Micro chip/module.

            The build system will search for the specified file in the following locations:
              1. morsefirmware/ in the root of the application being built
              2. framework/morsefirmware/ in the mm-iot-esp32 SDK (defined via the MMIOT_ROOT environment variable)

            If the file is not found in either location, a warning will be reported during
            configuration.
